# Sunlight Data
A reimaging of CDC weather data, as suggested (sort of) by the Elm Guide. I thought the data looked interesting and wanted to graph it.

# How to use
You might have to run `elm install` after cloning, or maybe it does it automagically, but you can use `elm reactor` to view, or `elm make src/Main.elm`

## To do
* Better controls - make double slider for year selection
* Better viz - can't tell which graph line is for which state, would be nice to see exact plot point values
* Better state selector - on some screens it will be hard to pick Rhode Island and other less important states
