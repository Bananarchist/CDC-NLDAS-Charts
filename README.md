# Sunlight Data
A reimaging of CDC weather data, as suggested (sort of) by the Elm Guide. I thought the data looked interesting and wanted to graph it.

# How to use
You might have to run `elm install` after cloning, or maybe it does it automagically, but you can use `elm reactor` to view, or `elm make src/Main.elm`

## To do
* Add precipitation data
* Better controls - create US Map Selector component
* Move to different plotting library for MOAR CHAART POWAHR
